# Rust Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to Rust journey! This repository is a collection of my explorations, projects, and experiments as I dive into the Rust programming language. Whether you're a beginner like me or an experienced Rustacean, I hope you find something interesting or useful here.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal log of my progress in learning Rust. It includes:

- Small practice exercises
- Larger projects that showcase specific Rust features (Coming soon!)
- Links to useful resources and tutorials

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Here are a few reasons why I'm excited to learn Rust:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
- **Performance**: Rust's performance is comparable to languages like C and C++, making it ideal for systems-level programming.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's concurrency model makes it easier to write safe and efficient concurrent code.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects I've worked on so far:

1. **Guessing Game**: A command-line guessing game inspired by the Rust book.
2. **Nth Fibonacci**: A command-line program that generates the `nth` fibonacci number inspired by the Rust book.
3. **Temperature Converter**: A command-line temperature converter inspired by the Rust book.
4. **Twelve Days of Christmas Lyrics**: A simple program that prints out the lyrics of the "Twelve Days of Christmas" song.

## Learning Resources

These are some of the resources I've found helpful during my Rust journey:

- [The Rust Programming Language (The Rust Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) - an online editor for writing and running Rust code.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, but I'm open to contributions! If you have suggestions, improvements, or find bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
